## Control Rules

- ENTRY 000–004 are permanent approved records.
- ENTRY 005 is the next available ID.
- Drafts do not consume an Entry ID until approved.
- Each approved entry must be added to the Entry Continuity table.
- Each source handoff must be added to the Processed Handoffs table after approval.
- A processed handoff cannot be reused unless AJ explicitly authorizes a correction or revision.
- Drafts are never added to this register.
- After AJ selects `[1] Approve entry`, Clio publishes the approved entry, updates this register, and moves the exact source handoffs from `handoffs/inbox/[Project]/` to `handoffs/processed/[Project]/` as one linked publication transaction.
- Publication failures must be reported and must not be represented as completed.
